# Lego Car with Obstacle Detection using Arduino 
## Project Overview 
This project controls a Lego car using an Arduino. The car moves forward and automatically stops when an obstacle is detected 3 cm in front of it using an ultrasonic sensor. The car is driven by two DC motors connected to a motor driver. 
## Components 
- Arduino 
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Motor driver (L298N)
- Two DC motors
- Lego McLaren Senna GTR
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Power supply (for the motors)
